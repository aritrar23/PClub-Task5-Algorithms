# PClub-Task5-Algorithms

The .ipynb file will run on any Jupyter Notebook environment. Also you may copy the code and paste it in any Python 3 environment, it will run fine. Remember to replace the 3 file paths in the beginning with the respective file paths in your system. Follow the comments, they provide the instructions. The allot.csv and stats.csv will be generated in the same directory as your notebook once you run the code. I have also attached my allot.csv and stats.csv in my repo. Also I have included the pdf file detailing my approach to the probelem - Approach.pdf.
